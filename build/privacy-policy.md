Delirio ("we," "us," or "our") provides an AI-powered fitness coaching mobile application. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our app.

When you interact with our AI coaches (via text, SMS, WhatsApp, or voice), we store:

This enables our AI coaches to remember your context and provide personalized guidance across sessions.

### Camera and Pose Data

Our app uses your device's camera to analyze your exercise form in real time. **This analysis happens entirely on your device using Apple's Vision framework. We do not collect, transmit, or store any video footage or pose data from your camera.**

## How We Use Your Information

We use your information to:

- Provide personalized fitness coaching and real-time form feedback
- Track your workout progress over time
- Enable our AI coaches to remember your preferences and goals
- Communicate with you about your fitness journey
- Improve our app and services

## How We Process Your Data

### On-Device Processing

Exercise form analysis is processed entirely on your device. Your camera feed and body position data never leave your phone.

### Cloud Processing

Voice and text conversations with our AI coaches are processed using third-party AI service providers. These providers process your messages to generate responses but do not retain your data for their own purposes.

We use the following categories of service providers:

- **Cloud infrastructure providers** for data storage and authentication
- **AI service providers** for conversation processing and voice synthesis
- **Memory services** for storing conversation context and user preferences
- **Messaging providers** for SMS and WhatsApp communication

## Data Retention

We retain your data for as long as your account is active. If you wish to delete your account and all associated data, please contact us at amir7alsad@gmail.com. Upon receiving your request, we will delete your data from our systems and instruct our service providers to do the same.

## Data Security

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information. However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Children's Privacy

Delirio is not intended for users under 16 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.

## Your Rights

- Access the personal information we hold about you
- Request correction of inaccurate information
