Where it can be better: 
- Instead of the typical slow paced perosnality, it should be more bubbly and 
    friendly to make the user feel excited to download Delirio 

- Deflect/redirect any user message that is out of context with Delirio Context at the
    strongest interesction between user's message and DElirio Marketing context 

- Delirio Market context: an abstract content space containing all about Delirio's mission, motto, and details. 
    The prupsoe fo this abstract contextual space is to be a namk of information from which the bot extracts to reason 
    and complete its mission: pursuade users to believe they need Delirio and want Delirio, leading to their waitlist registration and ultimately becoming a beta user and final user 

- User feedback from dorm friends: 
    *   Agent should be more nice/less mean blunt and straight forward as it seems to attatch  users ego with very aggressive responses. 
    * We shouldnt aim to confront the user because this ticks off their ego and defensive mechanism - theyll want to defend their side/point/beliefs. 
    * Instead of challanging their beliefs, we want to redirect them 

- Agent should ask more questions to help redirect the user's belief and get more information about the user to better pursuade them
